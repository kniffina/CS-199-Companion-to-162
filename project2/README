Description: This is the README file for project2 cs 199. It contains compilation instructions

Instructions for compilation: The programs have been added to a makefile named "prog". In order for the compilation to occur type make all, followed by prog. This will compile all of the programs together. To
 "clean" the files, type "clean all". 


My recursive function works by making the base case 1. Once n = 1 the function is returned. It uses the function call to decrement n - 1 times. The function calls itself until n = 1, and then it is returned. The function then addes its radius to its radius divided by n-1. This ensures that each time the radius is added to itself, the only thing that is added is 3. This makes sure that the function increments the value correctly.
