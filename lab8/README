Description: This is the README file for lab8 cs 199. It contains compilation instructions

Instructions for compilation: The programs have been added to a makefile named "prog". In order for the compilation to occur type make all, followed by prog. This will compile all of the programs together. To
 "clean" the files, type "clean all". 


Three Things I learned from this lab:

1)Learned how to correctly add elements to static array of a stack class

2)How to keep track of the amount of elements in my stack class by using a member variable and counting each time it is added or removed.

3)I also learned how loop through the stack list and display all of the elements. 

Three things I found difficult

1) At first I had while loops that would go through each variable until there was a NULL value and at the value the user had entered.
I realized that this worked until the stack was full. In order to make it easier I just used a member variable that kept track of the number of elements.

2) The other thing I found difficult was making sure that values were set to NULL instead of deleted. I am used to dynamic memory and it threw me off a little.

3) The rest of the lab seemed pretty simple. Hopefully, I was able to interpret and accomplish all of the tasks, but overall it seemed like a very straight forward assignment.
